Make me a GUI desktop application that has:
- Static text field at the top Move your mouse around  within the Window".
- under the title i want a session id to be displayed. The session ID should be a uuid and looklike
"ID:{session_id}"
- under the title i want the mouse coordinates to be displayed.
The have to be taken from the mouse movement. For example "Coordinates: (621, 107)"
